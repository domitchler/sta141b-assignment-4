       " 'title': 'Kamala Harris in the Senate',\n",
       " 'text': 'WASHINGTON — Sen. Kamala Harris’ communications director has a note in all capital letters stuck on her office computer: “Show the math.” It’s a quote from her boss — one the senator uses frequently. “There’s, I think, a running joke in the office about certain phrases I use all the time,” the California Democrat said. “This is how I would train lawyers, prosecutors about trial techniques: I’d say, ‘When you’re standing before the jury, in your closing argument ... show them the math.’ Instead of saying, ‘You must find 8,’ show them 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2.” The “Kamalism,” as one former staffer called it, is far from the only remnant of her prosecutor past that followed her to Washington. That background has helped define Harris’ time in the Senate — which will draw intensive scrutiny if, as expected, she declares her candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Harris’ Senate colleagues frequently refer to her prosecutorial approach to the job, noting in particular her propensity for sharp questioning of Trump administration officials during committee hearings. Harris foreshadowed that approach in her election night speech in which she emphasized her intention to “fight” in Washington. But she said she’s trying to use her bully pulpit to fight “not against something, (but) for something” — which has turned out to include issues as broad as immigration and income disparity and as specific as honoring historic victims of lynchings. The emphasis on her lawyer past is also evidence of her adjustment to being a freshman legislator. Harris’ two years in the Senate have been the only ones of her career in a legislative body, and her impact has been more visible in public face-offs than in policy. Harris’ tussles with President Trump’s nominees have earned her the most attention. Her interrogation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his August confirmation hearing about whether he had discussed the investigation into Russian election interference with anyone at a law firm connected to Trump gave C-SPAN one of its most-watched YouTube videos of the year. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Harris during a 2017 hearing that her rapid-fire questions made him “nervous. ... If I don’t qualify it, you’ll accuse me of lying. I’m not able to be rushed this fast.” During a tense, interruption-filled exchange with John Kelly in 2017, the then-homeland security secretary asked, “Would you let me finish once?” “Excuse me, I’m asking the questions,” Harris said, pressing on. “It’s a constant pursuit of the truth. You know, ‘What happened?’” Harris, 54, said in an interview. “It’s not about me giving a beautiful speech in those hearings. It’s about finding out: Is our government doing its job? Are we being accountable? Are we being transparent? Are we conducting ourselves consistent with the mores and the values of our country?” That style has been polarizing. Her supporters praise it as a no-nonsense form of oversight. Her detractors describe it as inappropriate or grandstanding. Former Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller set off a firestorm when he said her questioning of Sessions was “hysterical.” After Harris pressured Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in an Intelligence Committee hearing about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s independence, panel Chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., cut her off and said she wasn’t giving Rosenstein “the courtesy ... for questions to get answered.” The episode prompted a tweet from Sen. Elizabeth Warren with the “#NeverthelessShePersisted” hashtag that the Massachusetts Democrat herself inspired. But even her Republican colleagues who sparred with her during those hearings say they respect Harris’ sharpness. “She’s quite a fighter, and you saw that between me and her on the Kavanaugh hearings,” said GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee. “She’s always treated me fairly and ... if I were in the minority and I didn’t want someone like Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court, I probably would have taken the same approach.” “I’m not sure I’d necessarily want to be a witness in front of her,” said Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who chairs the homeland security committee. “Some Kavanaugh stuff wasn’t my cup of tea, but I think she’s very bright, has a good personality,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the new chair of the Judiciary Committee. “Anybody who underestimates her will do so at their own peril.” Harris’ legislative record is thin, not a surprise for a first-term senator in the minority party, but already a potential talking point for those taking aim at her ambitions. “She’s pretty new at it, as we all were at one time,” said Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn. “But I guess President (Barack) Obama demonstrated you didn’t have to stay here and develop much of a record in order to run for president.” A presidential run would invite close examination of Harris’ work in the Senate for clues about how she might govern. Much of that work speaks to the Democrats’ progressive base. She was the first Democratic senator to announce she would co-sponsor Medicare for All legislation from Sen. Bernie Sanders, independent-Vt. She was one of just three Democrats to vote against compromise legislation that would have protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation, in exchange for other cuts to legal immigration visas and $25 billion for Trump’s wall and other border security measures. Harris called the wall money a waste and said the overall bill would have advanced Trump’s “anti-immigrant” agenda. In late 2018, Harris introduced her approach to helping working families through tax credits to alleviate the strain of rising housing prices and other cost-of-living increases. Harris said she was “so damn excited” about the legislation and that she had spent nearly her entire two years in office working on it, trying to achieve something “meaningful and relevant and substantial.” Perhaps her most-recognized legislative achievement came in the final week of the last congressional term, when a bill she co-sponsored with the only other African Americans in the Senate, Democrat Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Tim Scott of South Carolina, to make lynching a federal crime passed the Senate unanimously. Harris noted that Congress has repeatedly failed to pass such legislation since 1882 and said the Senate vote “offered some long-overdue justice and recognition to the victims of lynching crimes.” The bill, however, still hasn’t become law: The House failed to take it up before Congress adjourned, meaning it would have to be reintroduced and pass both chambers again. Harris has also partnered with Republicans on other pieces of ultimately unsuccessful legislation, including a bail reform bill with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and an election security measure with Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. Harris’ colleagues from both parties describe her as affable and focused, with a command of key issues and an ability to ask skilled questions. They also cite her preparation and her friendliness with all lawmakers. Booker, a close friend of the senator’s who like Harris is a probable 2020 presidential contender, said she brings much to Washington by virtue of who she is — only the second African American woman ever to serve in the Senate. “I hear her voice, I see her in private, I see her in caucus, I see her in a lot of the meetings we have behind closed doors, and I’m telling you right now, she brings something powerful and unique to this body,” Booker said. But Harris is not without her Democratic critics — and many of them focus on her prosecutor past as their concern. The Twitter hashtag “#KamalaHarrisIsACop” is popular among her progressive detractors, who point to her work in law enforcement that they say disproportionately affected people of color. “Kamala Harris is entitled to no scrutiny, just like every other Democratic politician who is loved by Clinton donors. Also, war is peace,” progressive commentator David Sirota, a one-time congressional staffer for Sanders, tweeted sarcastically in 2017. It came during a time he highlighted her role as California attorney general in the approval of a California hospital merger criticized by nurses and abortion rights activists, as well as misconduct in a crime lab during her tenure as San Francisco district attorney. Harris seemingly tries to deflect progressive criticism in her new memoir, writing that it’s “a false choice to suggest you must either be for the police or for police accountability.” Given racial disparities in arrest rates that harm “black and brown people,” “egregious” police shootings and outfitting of police departments like “military regiments,” she wrote, “is it any wonder that the very credibility of these public institutions is on the line?” Harris is the daughter of two immigrants — her mother is from India and her father is from Jamaica — who met at UC Berkeley and fell in love during the height of the civil rights movement. She said a “duty to serve” was nonnegotiable growing up. The dual importance of the movement and her law enforcement past is evident in her sparsely decorated Senate office. A bust of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, an award, sits on a credenza with a law-enforcement-heavy challenge coin collection. There is a photo of Harris on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., with civil rights great Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. Another picture shows Harris, her husband, Douglas Emhoff, and their two children from Emhoff’s previous marriage marching in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade. And there’s her prized possession, a photograph of her mother and a close friend as young women on the UC Berkeley campus in the early 1960s. In the background are people wearing black armbands, often a symbol of protest and mourning for ’60s activists. A sign refers to Birmingham, Ala., a focal point of the civil rights movement. Harris’ mother, a breast cancer researcher, raised her after divorcing her father when Harris was 7. Her mother died in 2009. “I talk a lot about my mother,” Harris said as she held the picture. “So this is, I think, my favorite thing on this desk.” This job is not the first time Harris has worked in that very office. In 1984, as a student at Howard University, Harris was an intern for Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who occupied the same Hart Senate Office Building suite. She was tasked with answering constituents’ mail. The experience taught her that even as “a lowly student, I could make decisions or work on something that could impact millions of people.” Harris, however, said she never intended to return to Washington as an officeholder. “I enjoy being in the executive branch,” she said. “I enjoy being able to make decisions and then roll up my sleeves and just pursue and get stuff done.” She went to law school and became a prosecutor in the Bay Area, winning election as San Francisco district attorney in 2003. Seven years later, she narrowly won a race for California attorney general. She had just won a second term when Sen. Barbara Boxer announced in 2015 that she wouldn’t run for re-election the next year. Harris decided that as a senator she could get things done “on a national scale.” She announced her candidacy and cruised toward victory, expecting to be playing a supporting role to a Hillary Clinton White House — right up until the presidential numbers came in on election night. “I had a speech that was prepared,” Harris recalled, “and then through the course of the night it became apparent what was happening nationally, and I just went out there and kind of just riffed on what I felt in that moment.” What Harris ended up telling the stunned crowd at the Exchange LA nightclub in Los Angeles was that when “fundamental values are being attacked ... we fight” — for immigration reform, civil rights, abortion rights and “truth and transparency.” It didn’t take long for her fighting moments to arrive. She voted against 18 of Trump’s 22 original Cabinet-level nominees, one of the highest “no” rates among Democratic senators. She was one of only 11 Democrats to vote against Kelly for homeland security secretary, presaging a relationship that would become heated before he left the job to become White House chief of staff. One of their earliest interactions occurred outside of public view, in a small office in the Capitol known as a “hideaway” borrowed from California’s senior senator, Dianne Feinstein. Harris said she was talking with Kelly about immigration when it occurred to her to ask, “Have you ever met a ‘Dreamer’?” — young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children who are temporarily protected from deportation under an Obama-era program. “And he said no,” Harris said. “I asked him if he would be willing to meet with them. … And he said, ‘Well, can I meet with their representative instead?’” The White House did not respond to a request for comment before Kelly left in December. Shortly after Harris’ exchange with Kelly, Trump signed his first version of a travel ban barring people from several Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S. Harris recalls sitting on the “rented stools” in the kitchen of her new D.C. apartment that night and fielding calls from immigration lawyers she had worked with as California attorney general. “Then I said, ‘OK, well, we just got through confirming John Kelly,’ so I say to my team, ‘Get me his number. I need to call him and find out what’s going on.’” She did call him, at home. “He’s not too happy,” she said. “Later, I learned I guess that’s just not something that senators normally do.” The episode inspired her first piece of legislation, to guarantee that anyone detained trying to enter the U.S. would have access to legal counsel. Her first floor speech followed, an address criticizing Trump’s immigration policies that she grounded in the stories of her parents. Former staffer Sergio Gonzales said Harris often met in her office with young immigrant activists, many of whom were undocumented. Harris would hear their stories, tell them to stay positive and hug them as they cried, he said. “You don’t always see that” with lawmakers, Gonzales said. “Sometimes it is just politics to them, and they would walk out of the room and not think about it again. And these stories, they stayed with her.” He added that it was her idea to put up a sign outside their office that reads, “Dreamers are welcome here,” so they knew they had a place in the building to recharge and get support. In fact, Harris said, it is constituent work that she is most proud of in her time as a senator. “I don’t believe that the people who elected me elected me to be a pundit on cable news,” Harris said. “They elected me to address their issues, and I take that job very seriously.” She said she is “enjoying” the Senate — before correcting herself. “I feel relevant,” she said. “Let’s just say that. I feel a sense of purpose. People ask me all the time, ‘Are you having fun?’ I wouldn’t characterize it that way. But I do feel a sense of purpose.”   Tal Kopan is The San Francisco Chronicle’s Washington correspondent. Email: tal.kopan@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @talkopan  ',\n",

       " 'title': 'SF mayor, supes differ on use of city’s $181 million windfall: Let wrangling begin',\n",
       " 'text': 'The political wrangling around the $181 million the city unexpectedly received last week began Tuesday, as Mayor London Breed and a number of supervisors offered differing visions on how they want to spend the extra money. The proposals, which were introduced Tuesday at the Board of Supervisors meeting, concern the unexpected $415 million windfall the city received from excess revenue in a county education fund. While the City Charter mandates that more than half the money go toward budget reserves and certain city agencies, such as the Municipal Transportation Agency, the mayor and board have free rein over how to spend $181 million. Breed and the six supervisors who sponsored the competing proposal  — Aaron Peskin, Rafael Mandelman, Sandra Lee Fewer, Hillary Ronen, Norman Yee and Jane Kim — agree that most of the money should be spent on homelessness and housing initiatives. They differ, however, on exactly how much. And because the board won’t be able to take up the allocation until next year, when its composition will shift to a progressive majority, deciding how the funds are spent is likely to amount to one of the mayor’s first political tests of how she can negotiate with a left-leaning board. The mayor wants to use the money largely to meet the goals of Proposition C, a November ballot measure she opposed that would raise $300 million in taxes from the city’s largest businesses to fund homeless services. The measure passed with 61 percent approval, but is facing possible legal challenges that could hold up the money for months or even years. Breed is proposing to split the extra money into two chunks: $90.5 million for the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development and $90.5 million for the Departments of Public Health and the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing together. The money would go toward specific initiatives, such as jump-starting her ambitious goal of adding 1,000 shelter beds by the end of 2020 and conducting a performance review of the city’s existing homelessness programming. Meanwhile, the supervisors’ proposal — spearheaded by Peskin — seeks to divvy up the money in a more diverse way: $121 million for the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development and the Department of Public Health; $10 million to help meet some of the goals of June’s Universal Childcare for All ballot initiative, which is wrapped up in a lawsuit; and $50 million to go toward reducing San Francisco’s reliance on Pacific Gas and Electric Co. The board’s proposed $50 million allocation to purchase electric utility equipment from PG&E would give the city more independence from the utility company, potentially easing the friction of recent years about how power gets delivered to some municipal facilities. City officials have complained that PG&E’s insistence on what critics call arbitrary technical requirements has resulted in substantial delays and cost overruns on numerous city projects — including affordable housing developments, recreation spaces and public-safety facilities. Years of tensions between the city and PG&E peaked in March when Barbara Hale, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission’s general manager in charge of power, accused PG&E of requiring city projects to be built to handle power loads far beyond what was actually needed. At the time, Hale said that at least 16 projects were facing delays because of the utility’s mandates, some by over a year. PG&E maintains that it’s unfair for San Francisco to take advantage of the utility’s infrastructure without having to own or maintain any equipment, and it has cited the arcane Federal Power Act to back up its claims. The utility’s position is that the city must meet its requirements and install equipment of its own if it wants to transmit electricity over PG&E’s lines at wholesale prices. Since 2014, PG&E and the city have waited for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to sort out the matter, but a judgment could take years. The sudden influx of cash came from the Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund, or ERAF, a state program that shifts a portion of local property taxes to public school systems in each county. When county auditors determine that the fund has enough money to meet the minimum state funding requirements for its public schools and community colleges, the remaining funds are returned to the local governments — with few restrictions on how they’re spent. This is the first time San Francisco is receiving excess ERAF money. The exact figure, $414.7 million, includes excess ERAF for both the previous and current fiscal year. City Controller Ben Rosenfield said his office is working with the State Controller’s Office to determine if the city is owed excess ERAF money from previous years. Tuesday’s proposals will set off a 30-day legislative waiting period. Details will be debated in 2019, when three new supervisors — Matt Haney in District Six, Gordon Mar in District Four and Shamann Walton in District 10 — join the board. The outcome of the November election put into question how many allies Breed will have on the 11-member board when it comes to fulfilling key parts of her agenda — and it remains to be seen how she will negotiate the use of the excess funds with a progressive-majority board. “The mayor wants to ensure funding goes to affordable housing and homelessness, so we can help people get off the streets,” said Jeff Cretan, the mayor’s spokesman. “She looks forward to discussing her priorities with the board, as well as their priorities in the coming weeks.” Ronen said Tuesday is only the beginning of the conversation on how to spend the money. “What’s going to happen here is that there are going to be two different versions of how to spend that money, and we’ll have a very public debate and make different cases, and then meld them together,” she said.',\n",

       "'Under the threat of huge penalties, Airbnb, HomeAway, FlipKey and others have jettisoned hosts who ignored the city’s registration requirement for short-term rentals. That’s dramatically revamped the universe of listings, erasing more than half, tilting the market even more toward Airbnb, easing enforcement of local laws, and returning some rental units to a city that desperately needs them. The Chronicle asked Host Compliance, a San Francisco company that helps cities monitor vacation rentals, to capture snapshots of Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey in late August, just before a legal agreement required Airbnb and HomeAway to start telling hosts to register or get kicked off. Host Compliance then extracted data from the three sites on Jan. 19, just after a deadline for all Airbnb and HomeAway hosts to register. (FlipKey did not have the same deadline but is subject to the same requirements.) “The regulations had a massive impact on the number of rentals in the city, with an overall 55 percent reduction,” said Ulrik Binzer, Host Compliance CEO and founder. Airbnb saw the smallest percentage loss. Both HomeAway and FlipKey showcase many second homes, which cannot qualify as vacation rentals here because the owners are not permanent residents. Neither of those two sites list private rooms or shared rooms, which remain staples on Airbnb. “We see Jan. 16, 2018, as a hard reset,” said Airbnb spokesman Christopher Nulty. “We’re proud of the fact that as of then, every listing on our platform in San Francisco is in full compliance with the rules.” Airbnb listings fell from 8,740 in August to 4,191 in January, data showed. That number includes a couple of hundred listings at hotels, hostels and time shares, which don’t have to register. Airbnb said in addition it has 2,480 listings exempt from registration because they rent for more than 30 days. FlipKey, owned by TripAdvisor, said it worked closely with San Francisco to comply with its laws. Its listings plunged from 401 in August to 78 in January. HomeAway, owned by Expedia, did not respond to requests for comment. It had 1,208 listings in August; 509 in January. The data further reveal a series of dramatic alterations in how the short-term rental market works in San Francisco. Frequent renters. Entire homes with frequent streams of tourists are a controversial category. The city caps whole-home rentals at 90 days. Vacation rentals where the host is present have no cap. While prolific whole-home listings remain, many may be suites in people’s homes, which are legal to rent year-round. For instance, Gustav Choto and his wife, Nataly, turned the family room in their Crocker-Amazon home into an Airbnb rental. They’ve outfitted it with a microwave, coffee maker and mini fridge, and list it as a whole home, which some travelers prefer. But others prefer to socialize. “Sometimes we just pop open the door (to the rest of the house) so we can hang out with the guests,” Choto said. Many of the busiest listings are hotels. The most-booked Airbnb properties are the Bartlett Hotel, the Green Tortoise Hostel and the 325 Hotel. Some may be properties that have applied to register and can stay on the site while their applications are pending. There are 900 registrations in process. “Some of what you are seeing as noncompliant listings would be weeded out through our review — and ultimately denial — of such applications,” said Kevin Guy, director of the Office of Short-Term Rentals. At the other end of the spectrum, dormant listings — ones with little or no activity — virtually vanished. Many locals may have thrown up a listing in early 2016 hoping to lure lucrative Super Bowl visitors without ever having hosted. Neighborhood impact. The Mission remains the most-popular neighborhood for vacation rentals, but it now has 505 listings across all three sites, down from 1,127 in August. Some neighborhoods, such as Russian Hill, Nob Hill, Mission Bay and Western Addition, had particularly steep declines in listings. Hosts and others said that’s because those areas have a higher concentration of renters who didn’t want to register, because that process involves the city contacting their landlord — and subletting may violate their leases. Lakeshore saw a steep decline, which the Office of Short-Term Rentals attributes to college students who rent at the Parkmerced complex scrubbing their Airbnb listings. Treasure Island, run by an agency that does not allow vacation rentals, saw all its listings wiped out. But not all landlords eschew Airbnb rentals. In 2015, when Ryan Booth first saw a North of Panhandle flat on the top floor of a Queen Anne Victorian, the landlord said he wanted prospective tenants to compete with their best offer. Booth said he could pay $5,000 a month if the landlord gave him permission to rent via Airbnb — and he landed the place. He turned the living room into his bedroom and the original bedroom into a space for tourists. After expenses, it covers about 60 percent of his rent, although it’s more work than simply having a roommate. “In my mind it’s worth the extra effort,” he said. “I like interacting with guests.” The housing market. HotPads, the Zillow Group’s rentals site, saw an unprecedented surge of new ads for apartments to rent the third week in January — just as the registration deadline kicked in. The increased inventory did not affect pricing. HotPads said the increased listings were existing buildings heavily concentrated in the Mission, South of Market and South Beach, all popular Airbnb spots. It appears “that a large number of people who got lopped off Airbnb changed to advertising as long-term rentals,” said Joshua Clark, HotPads economist. But Airbnb disputed that, noting that HotPads does not release the exact numbers of units, and that HotPads overall is growing as it catches up with Craigslist. In fact, HotPads showed that total San Francisco inventory rose only modestly in the third week in January, which it attributes to rapid absorption. Even the San Francisco Office of Short-Term Rentals cautioned that it’s a leap to portray the city ban as the sole cause of a dramatic increase in rentals. Some, but not all of the gain, could be because of former short-term rental listings, Guy said. For instance, his office weeded out some syndicates in South of Market that rented out three to 10 properties and ran high-volume Airbnbs. Those presumably now have been returned to the rental pool. “I think Airbnb was a convenient scapegoat for not addressing the root causes” of San Francisco’s housing shortage, such as failure to build enough units, said David Jacoby, an Airbnb host who also runs a business called Hostfully that helps hosts create digital guidebooks for their spaces. Multiple-property hosts. San Francisco wants to catch landlords who turn apartments into hotels. Hosts who list several vacation rentals around the city are an obvious target because no one can live in multiple residences. The number of hosts with multiple listings shrank. While there are still 600 hosts who control two or more listings, the Office of Short-Term Rentals thinks they fall into permissible categories. Many are property managers, either professionals or family members, Guy said. Hosts with a couple of listings could easily be people with two or more bedrooms to rent, or a bedroom plus the entire unit when they are away. With the registration system, the city can see for itself if this is the case. “By and large, folks who take multiple units off the market have been swept out through enforcement and this settlement agreement process,” he said. Longer-term short-term. There’s a loophole for landlords who can’t register because they don’t live here. They can rent for a minimum of 30 days, exempting them from registration. Airbnb said it has 2,480 such listings. HomeAway and FlipKey showcases scores of these rentals. Although 30-plus day rentals are less popular — and less lucrative — than the shorter-term ones, they can lure corporate travelers or people relocating. “A lot of people are switching to (30-plus) day rentals,” said Emily Benkert, who runs Guesthop, a vacation-management service. “They’re not greedy slumlords. They’re people who travel a lot, and have multiple homes; they may be bicoastal. They don’t want to rent out full time and be stuck with a tenant for the rest of their life.” Many hosts say they’ve made peace with the new system and hope it will usher in a new era of detente between Airbnb and its hometown. “I think it’s a good idea,” homeowner Choto said. “We’ve all seen how some people were not true to the spirit of Airbnb, which is a hosted experience. There were people out there who used to make profit and take properties off the market, which I think is wrong. It’s good to hold people to standards.” Among hosts, “not everyone is happy with how this all happened,” Jacoby said. “But they’ve come to terms with this as a fair compromise.” Methodology Host Compliance collected data from the websites of Airbnb, HomeAway and FlipKey on Aug. 29, just before Airbnb and HomeAway began a five-month process of informing San Francisco hosts that they need to register with the city to stay on the sites. Host Compliance collected data again on Jan. 19, just after a deadline for unregistered hosts to be jettisoned. It used proprietary analytics tools to determine factors such as rental frequency and to analyze the composition of hosts who left and those who stayed.'"
