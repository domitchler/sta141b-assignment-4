       " 'text': 'The book “Gardenlust: A Botanical Tour of the World’s Best New Gardens” by Christopher Woods (Timber Press, 416 pages, $40) shows you gardens from around the globe, including some surprising places such as Oman, Singapore and the island of Nevis in the West Indies, all of them created in the past 20 years. Fifty gardens or designers are featured. The sites are all engaging; some are breathtaking. Woods, the author and major photographer of the book, began his career as a gardener at Kew Gardens in London. He then worked at a number of public gardens in England and the U.S., including 20 years as director and chief designer of Chanticleer Arboretum in Pennsylvania. (I have been to Chanticleer and have seen the Ruins Garden he created there from the stone and slate ruins of the home of the original owner of the property. It’s a spectacular piece of garden art, which includes  the work of Berkeley garden sculptor Marcia Donahue.) Because Woods understands the need for well-planned garden form as well as for horticultural skill and knowledge, he gives us both perspectives in “Gardenlust.” You will learn the names and view the work of forward-looking garden designers the world over. You will also find discussions of certain soils and for important plants in each garden, their common as well as scientific names down to the often all-important cultivar name. I also enjoyed Woods’ explorations of some common themes in gardens of our new century. One of these themes is conservation through cultivation — bringing native plants into gardens to ensure their survival. One of many examples is Pad Te Ke Botanical Garden in Laos, where 250 of that nation’s 485 native orchids are being grown. Another is the Jardín de Salvias in Mar del Plata, Argentina, where a former Buenos Aires professor, Rolando Uría, has initiated a collection of salvia species. (I was particularly taken with a photograph of Salvia foveolata, a tall salvia species with light yellow flowers and dark red sepals.) A second common theme is environmental remediation. One example is the Naples Botanical Garden, in Naples, Fla., where a former shopping complex, garbage dump and parking lot has become a tropical paradise. Or consider Landschaftspark, in Duisburg-Nord, Germany, where the ruins of the former Thyssen smelting plant, which openly used slave labor during World War II,  is being redesigned into a park. Writes Woods: “Healing the wounds of history does not mean the expurgation of the past.” Here, the machinery that was used to create chemical and social toxins decays in place amid places to stroll, dance and play. A third theme is bringing nature into the hearts of our overcrowded cities. In Tokyo, Ichigaya Forest is being planted in open spaces between tall buildings. Here, native species are being allowed to form their usual untidy but wonderful forest mix, interrupted only by sidewalks taken by workers to and from their city jobs. Other urban plantings are on roofs or walls. In Singapore, exuberant plantings perch on concrete platforms several stories up, like shelf fungi on a tree. A fourth trend is a less formal style of gardening in which plantings appear to represent wild habitats, though only a portion of the plants used are truly native. Although a certain amount of reseeding and spreading is allowed, such plantings are nevertheless carefully curated and edited. This trend is also represented by the High Line in New York. (Not shown in this book. See the book “Gardens of the Highline,” Piet Oudolf and Rick Darke, Timber Press, 2017, which I reviewed in this column in June 2018). Woods shows and comments on several such “naturalistic” plantings. But, although the plantings are casual, they do require maintenance. Woods writes that he found the garden created for 2012 Olympics in London Olympic Park in such poor maintenance that “even benign neglect has been neglected.”  Other gardens, such as Junto Farm, a private garden in Hudson Valley, N.Y., and the public Martin Luther King Park in Paris, merit his high praise for both planting and maintenance. Threaded through the entries is much analysis of this trend. Woods calls it “a relaxed interpretation of nature, seeking not to overpower but to cohabit,” and says such plantings can “serve as a bridge between us and what we think of as untamed nature.” Nevertheless, he says, “there should be no pretense that they aren’t artificial.” That is, it should be clear that these gardens are not restorations of meadows and prairies that are truly gone. The book gains value in my eyes by the fact that over half of the gardens are public, and therefore visitable should you travel to where they are. Some are relatively near. For example, the Chihuly garden in Seattle where colored glass art plays against plants, or the Garden of Flowering Fragrance, a Chinese garden at the Huntington Botanical Garden in San Marino (Los Angeles County). Others are farther away, but who knows, life might take you to Sydney to stroll the modern abstract landscapes of the Australian Garden in the Royal Botanic Gardens, or to Said-Ul-Azaib, Delhi, India, to enjoy the contemplative splendor of the Garden of the Five Senses.',\n",
